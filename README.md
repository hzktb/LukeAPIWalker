  This is a personal assignment from my bootcamp

<p>To use this src folder, first you need to create a React app using npx create-react-app and then replace the src folder in the react folder with this src folder</p>
<p>The issue currently with this app is that inside the Display component, there is an Input component with props.setId that doesn't work.</p>
